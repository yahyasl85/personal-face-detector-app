Face Recognition System in Google Colab

This project demonstrates a real-time face recognition system built using Python and the face_recognition library within the Google Colab environment. It leverages webcam access for capturing training images and identifies individuals based on facial features. The system includes a portfolio section showcasing the recognized faces, and potential applications include security, access control, and personalized user experiences.

Key highlights:

Real-time face recognition: Captures and analyzes images in real time using the webcam.
Google Colab integration: Runs entirely within the Colab environment, leveraging its resources and accessibility.
Training and detection: Enables capturing training images and identifying known individuals in new images.
Portfolio display: Showcases the captured faces, offering a visual representation of the trained model.
Open-source and collaborative: Hosted on GitHub to encourage contributions and community involvement.
Potential use cases:

Security systems: Real-time monitoring and identification of individuals in restricted areas.
Access control: Granting access to authorized personnel based on facial recognition.
Personalized user experiences: Tailoring content and services based on recognized individuals.
Target audience:

Developers interested in face recognition and its applications.
Machine learning enthusiasts seeking practical examples and implementations.
Users exploring security and access control solutions using computer vision.
